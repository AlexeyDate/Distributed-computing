# Parallelization results
**Information about the processor on which the time estimation was performed:**
* AMD FX-8350
* 8 Cores, 8 threads
* Base frequency: 4000 mHZ
* Max frequency: 4200 mHZ
___
**Ð¡alculation of time from changing the number of points for 1, 2, 4, 8 threads. The range of points was from 50 to 2000 in increments of 50 points.**
